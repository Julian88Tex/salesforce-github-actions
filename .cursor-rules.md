# Cursor Project Rules for salesforce-github-actions

**META-RULE: After any edit to the repo, you MUST (1) commit and push the change, (2) trigger the GitHub Action (workflow), (3) provide a direct link to the triggered run's logs, (4) wait for the workflow to complete, and (5) extract and provide the org login URL as a clickable link. This rule takes precedence over all others and MUST be followed in every Cursor session, even in new or fresh sessions.**

**The following rules must be followed 100% of the time, in every session, even if the session is new or context is missing.**

**Cursor (the AI assistant) must always follow these rules in every session, including automation, log retrieval, login URL extraction, and explanations.**

1. **Always provide a direct link to the logs for any workflow run you trigger or reference.**
2. **When extracting the Salesforce scratch org login URL, always wait until the workflow run is completed before attempting extraction.**
3. **Extract the login URL from the logs using a robust pattern (e.g., grep for 'https://...frontdoor.jsp?sid=...').**
4. **Always provide the login URL as a clickable link in chat or output.**
5. **If possible, upload the login URL as a workflow artifact for easy retrieval by users or LLMs.**
6. **After any edit to the repo, always commit, push, trigger the workflow, provide a direct link to the logs, and wait for the workflow to complete before extracting and providing the org login URL.**
7. **Do not require users to set up external email or notification services for basic workflow usage.**
8. **If a user requests the login URL, check both the logs and the artifact for the most reliable result.**
9. **Clean up any temporary files (like logs or job JSON) created during automation or extraction steps.**
10. **Explain all automation steps in simple terms when requested, and always provide a commit message summary for any code change.**
11. **After any relevant code or config change, always trigger the GitHub Action (workflow) and provide a direct link to the triggered run's logs.**
