# Cursor Project Rules for salesforce-github-actions

1. **Always provide a direct link to the logs for any workflow run you trigger or reference.**
2. **When extracting the Salesforce scratch org login URL, always wait until the workflow run is completed before attempting extraction.**
3. **Extract the login URL from the logs using a robust pattern (e.g., grep for 'https://...frontdoor.jsp?sid=...').**
4. **Always provide the login URL as a clickable link in chat or output.**
5. **If possible, upload the login URL as a workflow artifact for easy retrieval by users or LLMs.**
6. **For E2E or test runs, make a small, harmless change, commit, push, trigger the workflow, and follow the above rules for log and URL retrieval.**
7. **Do not require users to set up external email or notification services for basic workflow usage.**
8. **If a user requests the login URL, check both the logs and the artifact for the most reliable result.**
9. **Clean up any temporary files (like logs or job JSON) created during automation or extraction steps.**
10. **Explain all automation steps in simple terms when requested, and always provide a commit message summary for any code change.**
